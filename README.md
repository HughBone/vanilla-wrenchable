# Vanilla-Wrenchable
Minecraft Fabric mod using Zundrel's Wrenchable API (https://github.com/Zundrel/Wrenchable) but modified to work on both clients and servers. For example, a vanilla client can connect to a server using the mod and wrench away!

## Crafting
![](readme-images/wrench_recipe.png)

## How to use:
* Right click any rotatable block (i.e. pistons, stairs, glazed_terracotta)
* Sneak and right click for wrench modifier (i.e. rotate pistons vertically)

## Requirements
* nbt-crafting - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nbt-crafting

## Future Plans
* Config file to change crafting recipe
* Right now, any carrot on a stick named "Wrench" will work. That is cringe. We only want the wrench that gets crafted to work.
